# Build-machine-learning-models-from-scratch

In this repository, I try to share some of the machine learning models I built in Python when I started learning them. 

Machine Learning in Action helped me a lot when I was a beginner. I refered to this book a lot to write codes and build models from scratch.

I used ex2data1.txt to test Lr and perceptron which I also uploaded to this repository.
